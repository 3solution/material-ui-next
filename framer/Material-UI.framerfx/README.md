# Material-UI

This is the official resource for Material-UI React components in Framer.

[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) is a library of React components for faster and simpler web development.
You can build your own design system, or start with Material Design.

- App bar

## Usage

### Icons

Icons can be specified using either snake_case (as documented on material.io),
or PascalCase, as used in [the Material-UI documentation](https://material-ui.com/components/material-icons/).
Simply type the icon name in the appropriate property control.

The icon theme can be chosen from the related select field.

### Children

Where a component (such as Avatar) accepts a variety of child types, these can be configured through Framer property controls.
If multiple options are supplied, they take the following priority:

- Local image
- Image URL
- Icon
- Text
