# Skeleton (Squelette)

<p class="description">Display a placeholder preview of your content before the data gets loaded to reduce load-time frustration.</p>

The data for your components might not be immediately available. You can improve the perceived responsiveness of the page by using skeletons. It feels like things are happening immediately, then the information is incrementally displayed on the screen (Cf. [Avoid The Spinner](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1797)).

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js"}}

## Utilisation

The component is designed to be used **directly in your components**. Par exemple:

```jsx
{item ? (
  <img style={{ width: 210, height: 118 }} alt={item.title} src={item.src} />
) : (
  <Skeleton variant="rect" width={210} height={118} />
)}
```

## Variants

The component supports 3 shape variants.

{{"demo": "pages/components/skeleton/Variants.js"}}

## Animations

By default, the skeleton pulsate, but you can change the animation for a wave or disable it entirely.

{{"demo": "pages/components/skeleton/Animations.js"}}

### Pulsate example

{{"demo": "pages/components/skeleton/YouTube.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Wave example

{{"demo": "pages/components/skeleton/Facebook.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false, "bg": true}}

## Inferring dimensions

In addition to accepting `width` and `height` props, the component can also infer the dimensions.

It works well when it comes to typography as its height is set using `em` units.

```jsx
<Typography variant="h1">
  {loading ? <Skeleton /> : 'h1'}
</Typography>
```

{{"demo": "pages/components/skeleton/SkeletonTypography.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

But when it comes to other components, you may not want to repeat the width and height. In these instances, you can pass `children` and it will infer its width and height from them.

```jsx
loading
  ? <Skeleton><Avatar /></Skeleton>
  : <Avatar src={data.avatar} />
```

{{"demo": "pages/components/skeleton/SkeletonChildren.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Accessibilit√©

Skeleton screens provide an alternative to the traditional spinner method. Rather than showing an abstract widget, skeleton screens create anticipation of what is to come and reduce cognitive load.

The background color of the skeleton uses the least amount of luminance to be visible in good conditions (good ambient light, good screen, no visual impairments).

### ARIA

None.

### Clavier

The skeleton is not focusable.
