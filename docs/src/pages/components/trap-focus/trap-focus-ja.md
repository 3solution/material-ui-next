# Trap Focus

<p class="description">Trap focus within a DOM node.</p>

TrapFocus is a component that manages focus for its descendants. This is useful when implementing overlays such as modal dialogs, which should not allow focus to escape while open.

When `open={true}` the trap is enabled, and pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> will rotate focus within the inner focusable elements of the component.

## ‰æã

## Disable enforce focus

Clicks within the focus trap behave normally; but clicks outside the focus trap are blocked.

You can disable this behavior with the `disableEnforceFocus` prop.

## Lazy activation

By default, the component moves the focus to its descendants as soon as it opens: `open={true}`.

You can disable this behavior and make it lazy with the `disableAutoFocus` prop. When auto focus is disabled, as in the demo below, the component only traps the focus once it gets focused.

## Portal

The following demo uses the [`Portal`](/components/portal/) component to render a subset of the trap focus children into a new "subtree" outside of the current DOM hierarchy, so that they no longer form part of the focus loop.
